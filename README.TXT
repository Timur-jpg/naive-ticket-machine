Part 2

 Question 2: The value returned is 0
 
 Question 3: Yes, I do notice something strange about the machine’s behavior. 
             If I insert too much money into the machine, it will give me the ticket, but it won't give me any refund. 
             If I do not insert enough and then try to print a ticket, it will still give me the ticket and take the money.
                                                                                                                     
 Question 5: Yes it does look different but it's only the price on the ticket that changed, the other tings stayed the same.
