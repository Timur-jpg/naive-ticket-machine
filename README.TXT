Answers: 

Part 2

 Question 2: The value returned is 0
 
 Question 3: Yes, I do notice something strange about the machine’s behavior. 
             If I insert too much money into the machine, it will give me the ticket, but it won't give me any refund. 
             If I do not insert enough and then try to print a ticket, it will still give me the ticket and take the money.
                                                                                                                     
 Question 5: Yes it does look different but it's only the price on the ticket that changed, the other tings stayed the same.
 
 Question 6: I think the outer wrappers of the Student and LabClass classes might look like the projecct we did before.
 
 Question 7: Yes, it does matter because when you change it, it marks the class diagram in red marks. Plus I cannot create a new object and it deletes my previous objects. 
             When I press the compile button, it redirect me too the source, where there is message on the bottom "Error(s) found in class".
             I think the message itself doesn't give a lot of information making it hard to know the problem, although the red lines on the left side helps.  
 
 Question 10: fields: price, balance, and total
              constructor: TicketMachine
              methods: getPrice, getBalance, insertMoney and printTicket
              
 Question 11: The constructor has a single formal parameter, cost, but the method has none. The constructor has no return type unlike the method.
 
 Question 12: int, Student and Server
 
 Question 13: alive, tutor and game
 
 Question 14:
